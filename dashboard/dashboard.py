    **Insight**:
    - **Working Days vs. Weekends**:
        - The bar chart shows a slight increase in the number of bike rentals on working days compared to weekends.
        - This trend suggests that bike rentals are primarily driven by commuting needs, with more users renting bikes during their daily work routines.
    - **User Type Influence**:
        - Registered users likely contribute to this higher rental count on working days, using bikes as a convenient transportation mode to and from work.
        - The relatively high rentals during weekends also indicate significant casual or leisure usage, even though it is lower compared to working days.

    **Insight**:
    - **Positive Correlation with Temperature**:
        - The scatter plot indicates a clear positive correlation between temperature and the number of bike rentals.
        - As the temperature increases, the number of bike rentals also tends to increase, reaching a peak at moderate to warm temperatures.
    - **Optimal Temperature Range**:
        - The highest density of bike rentals occurs within a normalized temperature range of around 0.4 to 0.8, suggesting that users prefer to rent bikes when it's neither too cold nor too hot.
        - Beyond this optimal range, the number of rentals starts to decline, possibly due to extreme weather conditions being less comfortable for biking.

st.markdown("""
**Summary**:
- **What is the trend of bike renting based on the days?**
    - **Higher Rentals on Working Days:** The data indicates that bike rentals are higher on working days compared to weekends. This suggests that a significant portion of the rentals are driven by commuters using the service for their daily travel to work or school.
    - **Weekend Rentals:** While the number of rentals is lower on weekends, it remains substantial, indicating that bikes are also used for recreational purposes during these days, likely by casual users.
    - **User Behavior:** The distinct pattern of higher rentals on weekdays points to registered users who are more consistent in their rental behavior, as they are likely using bikes as part of their daily routine.

- **What is the trend of bike rentals from the temperature?**
    - **Positive Correlation with Temperature:** There is a clear positive correlation between temperature and bike rentals. As the temperature rises to a moderate level, the number of bike rentals increases, indicating a preference for biking in warmer conditions.
    - **Optimal Temperature Range:** The highest bike rentals occur when the temperature is within a moderate range (normalized values of 0.4 to 0.8). This suggests that users are most comfortable riding when it's neither too cold nor too hot.
    - **Weather Sensitivity:** Extreme temperatures on either end of the scale tend to reduce the number of bike rentals, showing that weather conditions significantly influence user decisions to rent a bike.
